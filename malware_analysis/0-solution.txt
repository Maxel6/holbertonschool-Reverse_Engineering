After analyzing the files TextFieldKeyEventHandler.smali and KeyInputNode.smali, it was observed that the application intercepts key events using the onKey() method. The keystrokes are then sent to a remote server via HTTP requests using the HttpURLConnection class. This behavior suggests that the application acts as a keylogger and sends the captured data to a remote server. The presence of several files in androidx/compose/ui/input/key/ further supports the idea of active key event interception within the application.
